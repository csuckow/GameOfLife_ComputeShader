[Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), realized as a minimalistic compute shader in Unity. It starts with any image that can be added to the script and renders the progress to the screen. Every channel works separately, allowing the usage of RGB images. Just add them to the script on the camera.
